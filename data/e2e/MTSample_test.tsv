Sample Patient Dear Doctor: We had the pleasure of seeing Abc and his mother in the clinic today.	null
As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.	some very mild prematurity @problem@ very mild @severity@ @hasAttr@	null

You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.	steroids @drug@ inhaled @route@ @hasAttr@ bronchodilator @drug@ inhaled @route@ @hasAttr@	null
Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.	null
Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.	asthma @problem@ father @subject@ @hasAttr@ asthma @problem@ uncle @subject@ @hasAttr@ asthma @problem@ older sister. @subject@ @hasAttr@	null

On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.	exam @test@ today @temporal@ @hasAttr@	null
We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.	null
I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.	fairly severe childhood asthma @problem@ severe @severity@ @hasAttr@	null
I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).	symptom @problem@ free @negation@ @hasAttr@ steroids @drug@ off @negation@ @hasAttr@	null
I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.		null

Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now.	calcium channel blocker @drug@ now @temporal@ @hasAttr@ the beta-blocker @drug@ avoid @negation@ @hasAttr@	null
If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker.	an Esmolol @drug@ drip @route@ @hasAttr@	null
