Dear	O
Doctor	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
seeing	O
Abc	O
and	O
his	O

in	O
the	O
clinic	O

He	O
has	O
been	O
having	O
problems	B-problem
with	O
wheezing	B-problem
,	O
cough	B-problem
and	O
shortness	B-problem
of	I-problem

over	O

You	O
and	O
your	O
partners	O
have	O
treated	O
him	O
aggressively	O
with	O
inhaled	B-route
steroids	B-drug
and	O
bronchodilator	B-drug
.	O

Despite	O
this	O
,	O
however	O
;	O
he	O
has	O
had	O
persistent	B-problem
problems	I-problem
with	O
a	B-problem
cough	I-problem
and	O
has	O
been	O
more	O
recently	O
started	O

Although	O

is	O

his	O

The	O
parents	O
now	O
maintain	O
separate	O
households	O
and	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
question	O
about	O
the	O
consistency	O
of	O
his	O
medication	O
administration	O
at	O
his	O
father	O
'	O

house	O

On	O
exam	B-test
today	B-temporal
,	O
Abc	O
had	O
some	B-problem
scattered	I-problem
rhonchi	I-problem
which	O
cleared	O
with	O
coughing	B-problem
but	O
was	O
otherwise	O
healthy	O
.	O

We	O
spent	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
our	O
45	O
-	O
minute	O
just	O
reviewing	O
basic	O
principles	O
of	O
asthma	B-treatment
management	I-treatment
and	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
Abc	O
'	O
s	O
mother	O
is	O
fairly	O
well	O
versed	O
in	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
thing	O
to	O
realize	O
is	O
that	O
Abc	O
probably	O
does	O
have	O
fairly	B-problem
severe	B-severity
childhood	I-problem
asthma	I-problem
and	O
fortunately	O
has	O
avoided	O
hospitalization	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
prudent	O
to	O
continue	O
his	B-drug
alternate	I-drug
day	I-drug
steroids	I-drug
until	O
he	O
is	O
completely	O
symptom	B-problem
free	B-negation
on	O
the	O
days	O
off	B-negation
steroids	B-drug
but	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
reasonable	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
wean	O
him	O
down	O
to	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
1	O
.	O
5	O
milligrams	O
(	O
0	O
.	O
5	O
milliliters	O
on	O
alternate	O
days	O
)	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
encouraged	O
his	O
mother	O
to	O
contact	O
our	O
office	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
answer	O
questions	O
if	O
necessary	O
by	O
phone	O
.	O

Thanks	O
so	O
much	O
for	O
allowing	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
involved	O
in	O
his	O
care	O
